# Random Ideas API

This is a simple Express.js server for managing random ideas. The server includes basic setup for static file hosting, JSON body parsing, CORS handling, and API routing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14.x or later recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/random-ideas-api.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd random-ideas-api
    ```

3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your environment variables:
    ```
    PORT=5000
    DB_URI=your_database_connection_string
    ```

### Running the Server

1. Make sure the database is connected by configuring `./config/db.js` with your database connection logic.

2. Start the server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

3. The server will start listening on the port defined in your `.env` file or default to `5000`. You can access it at `http://localhost:5000`.

### API Endpoints

- `GET /`: A welcome message for the Random Ideas API.

- `GET /api/ideas`: Retrieve a list of all ideas.

- `POST /api/ideas`: Submit a new idea.

- `PUT /api/ideas/:id`: Update an existing idea by ID.

- `DELETE /api/ideas/:id`: Delete an idea by ID.

### Static Files

Static files are served from the `public` directory. Place any HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files you want to serve here.

### CORS

CORS is enabled for the following origins:
- `http://localhost:5000`
- `http://localhost:3000`

This allows your frontend application to interact with the API.
